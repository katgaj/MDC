        <p>What you need to cross-country ski is suitable equipment:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>skis</b> - compared to downhill skis, cross country skis are much skinnier—about half the width, in fact. This is because they are designed to tackle small hills at the most, with much of the terrain being primarily flat with occasional slight inclines</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>boots</b> - they are usually soft to provide more freedom of movement at both the push-off and forward-extension phases. They are attached to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing)</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>poles</b> -  ski poles are used for balance and propulsion. Modern cross-country ski poles are made from aluminium, fibreglass-reinforced plastic, or carbon fibre, depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly they were made of wood or bamboo. they run longer than downhill poles, this added length will help give you more propulsion as you're skating across flat surfaces</p>
