        <p>With time and practice, you may feel like taking up some HIIT trainings as well. You can easily achieve that by tossing in a few intervals in between. For instance, you could go hard for 30 seconds and then take a minute break in between or do a low-intensity activity – such as brisk walking.</p>
        <p>Also, activities such as hiking, trail running, biking, and even surfing can be excellent when cross-training for skiing. These can help build strength and power in the legs, improve cardiovascular fitness, and increase endurance. You will also learn how to read terrain and navigate obstacles when skiing.</p>
        <p>Roller skiing is another form of dryland training that cross-country skiers can perform off-season. This will also help you practice techniques and improve your overall endurance. As you can see, there are skills that you can transfer from these activities that can be immensely helpful when skiing.</p>
