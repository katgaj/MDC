        <p class="p_1" style="text-align: justify;">The word ski comes from the Old Norse word skíð which means a stick of wood. Skiing started as a technique for traveling cross-country over snow on skis, starting almost five millennia ago in Scandinavia, but it may have been practised as early as 600 BCE in China. Additionally, the Sami people have practiced skiing for more than 6000 years.</p>
        <p class="p_1" style="text-align: justify;">Early skiers used one long pole or spear in addition to the skis. The first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741. Traditional skis, used for snow travel in Norway and elsewhere into the 1800s, often comprised one short ski with a natural fur traction surface, the andor, and one long for gliding, the langski—one being up to 100 cm longer than the other—allowing skiers to propel themselves with a scooter motion.</p>
        <p class="p_1">Then over the centuries, cross-country skiing evolved from a utilitarian means of transportation to being a worldwide recreational activity and sport, which branched out into other forms of skiing starting in the mid-1800s. Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests as early as in the 18th century. An early record of a public ski competition occurred in Tromsø in 1843.</p>
        <p class="p_1">In Norwegian, langrenn refers to "competitive skiing where the goal is to complete a specific distance in groomed tracks in the shortest possible time". Using this definition as the backbone of its further development, skiing evolved into a competitive form of winter sports. The first FIS Nordic World Ski Championships took place in 1925 for men and in 1954 for women, and the first Winter Olympic Games were held in Chamonix, France, in 1924. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years.</p>
