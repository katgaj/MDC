        <p>What you eat as crucial as your training. You will need carbohydrates to fuel your functions. So choose a diet with low sugar and fat while including high fiber carbohydrate alternatives like whole-grain bread, cereals, and grains.</p>
        <p>Some skiers also prefer to take vitamin D since the winter months might not offer sufficient sunlight. While skiing, you should also remember to stay hydrated, preferably with water, and avoid caffeine. Also, the best choice would be a low-fat protein bar that will help to keep your energy up.</p>
